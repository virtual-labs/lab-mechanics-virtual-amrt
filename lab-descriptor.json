    "introduction": "The Mechanics Virtual Lab provides an interactive and simulation-based environment for exploring fundamental principles of classical mechanics. This laboratory emphasizes rotational dynamics and the behavior of non-linear mechanical systems, enabling students to visualize and analyze core physical phenomena such as torque, angular acceleration, moment of inertia, oscillations, projectile motion, and collisions. Through these simulations, learners gain deeper conceptual understanding and the ability to manipulate experimental variables in a safe, repeatable, and accessible virtual space.<br>By integrating technology with foundational physics education, this lab supports experiential learning without the constraints of physical laboratory infrastructure. It is particularly valuable in remote or resource-limited settings and complements traditional physics curricula by offering dynamic models and real-time feedback.",
